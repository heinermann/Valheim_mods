# Fair Passive Lighting

## Description
A passive lighting mod to complement (NOT replace) fueled lighting solutions. It works by taking any normal item and just making it brighter, inheriting its colour and intensity.

The lanterns in this mod only buff the light given by items that glow (i.e. swamp keys or dragon tears). By default it increases the range by 2.5 times (configurable). So the disadvantage is you would need many swamp keys and dragon tears to fill them up.

The light ranges provided by *some* items are listed here (note that this mod works with all glowing items including modded ones).

- Surtling Trophy, Frost Resist Mead, Freeze Gland: 1 -> 2.5
- Yellow Mushroom, Ancient Seed: 1.5 -> 3.75
- Frost Arrow, Thunderstone: 2 -> 5
- Swamp Key, Dragon Tear, Wishbone: 3 -> 7.5
- Yagluth Thing: 3.76 -> 9.4

A standing wooden torch for example has a light range of 10.

### Advantages
- No fuel needed.
- Many colour options.

### Disadvantages
- Expensive.
- Less light.
- Placement restrictions.
- Colours limited to item glow.
